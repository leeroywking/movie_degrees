# Six degrees of Lee-Roys Bacon

## Credits:
I used this dataset from kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/gorochu/complete-imdb-movies-dataset

## Setup instructions
After cloning this repo down you will need one additional file (because I'm a hack and deleted the code where I made this file out of movie.json which if I make this better in the future I'll definitely fix)
file can be found here
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P9OCPF_fvkafMzM-F8qubez6oGRsN9gx/view?usp=sharing
place the file in the same directory as everything else in this repo.

## Run the application
this was written using the standard libraries for Python3 so you should be able to run the program from your terminal by typing 
`python3 degree_finder.py`
